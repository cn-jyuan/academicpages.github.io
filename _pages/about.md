I am holding the full professorship at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xidian University in Xi'an, China. Currently, I am also a visiting professor at the École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS), Quebec University in Canada. I used to work as the research scientist at Robarts Research Institute, Western University in Canada, and the adjunct research professor at the Schulich Medical School, Western University in Canada.
