I am holding the full professorship at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, [Xidian University](http://www.xidian.edu.cn/) in Xi'an, China. Currently, I am also a visiting professor at the [École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS)](http://www.etsmtl.ca/), Quebec University in Canada. I used to work as the research scientist at [Robarts Research Institute](http://www.robarts.ca/), [Western University (UWO)](http://www.uwo.ca/) in Canada, and the adjunct research professor at the [Schulich Medical School](http://www.schulich.uwo.ca/), [Western University (UWO)](http://www.uwo.ca/) in Canada. 

**Research Instrests and Academic Services**
------
My major studies are in developing novel theories and implementations of optimization, variational analysis, algorithms and high-performance distributed parallel computing, especially with applications to most challenging practices of computer vision, medical image analysis and machine learning. I proposed a series of novel convex optimization models and fast algorithms under a unified dual optimization framework, which have been implemented on most modern high-performance parallel computing platforms and successfully applied in large-scale medical image computing, computer vision and machine learning. In addition, I focus on delivering new efficient computing methods and advanced parallel numerical tools with capabilities of processing "big data" in most modern applications of image segmentation, registration, motion estimation and machine learning.

I am serving in the program committee of top academic conferences such as MICCAI, EMMCVPR and IPTA, and constantly work as the reviewer of top journals and conferences: IEEE Trans. PAMI, IEEE TMI, Medical Image Analysis, SIAM on Imaging Sciences, IJCV, Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, CVPR, MICCAI, ICCV, EMMCVPR.
