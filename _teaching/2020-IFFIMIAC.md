International Forum on Frontiers of Intelligent Medical Image Analysis and Computing 2021 will be organized online by **Xidian University, Southeastern University and Hong Kong Baptist University**. The Forum is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant no. 20200027095).

## Introduction

The studies of intelligent medical image analysis and computing becomes an interdisciplinary science of modern medical image computing, artificial intelligence and big-data analysis etc., and an emerging frontier subject integrating the art of mathematical and theoretical research, engineering development and medicine study by 
an organic unity of different technical resources. With rapid developments of artificial intelligence and data analysis during recent years, AI and its related technologies have been successfully applied into all aspects of medical image analysis and computing, which largely improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and treatment by modern medical image-assisted diagnosis and surgery. At the same time, new medical imaging methods result in vast volume of data and motivate necessities of medical big-data analysis, which leads to new challenges in AI, big-data analysis and high-performance optimization computing, and encourages innovations and breakthroughs in both theory and technology. **The Intelligent Medical Image Analysis and Computing Frontier Forum 2021 is funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant no. 20200027095), and organized jointly by Xidian University / Frontier Research Institute of Xidian University, Southeast University, Hong Kong Baptist University and other collaborated universities**. **The forum includes talks, lectures and short courses presented by the invited speakers**.
