International Forum on Frontiers of Intelligent Medical Image Analysis and Computing 2021 will be organized online by **Xidian University, Southeastern University and Hong Kong Baptist University**. The Forum is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant no. 20200027095).

## Introduction

The studies of intelligent medical image analysis and computing becomes an interdisciplinary science of modern medical image computing, artificial intelligence and big-data analysis etc., and an emerging frontier subject integrating the art of mathematical and theoretical research, engineering development and medicine study by 
an organic unity, penetration and complementation of different technical resources. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and big data analysis technology in recent years, it has been successfully applied to all aspects of medical imaging data analysis and calculation, and the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and treatment has been greatly improved in the modern medical imaging assisted precision diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, the rapid development of contemporary new medical bioimaging methods and data generation technology, as well as the special needs of biomedical image data analysis, have put forward new challenges in the current fields of artificial intelligence, big data analysis and high-performance optimized computing. And research topics have led to major innovations and breakthroughs in these research fields. Funded by the introduction of high-end foreign experts from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Xidian University, Frontier Research Institute of Xidian University, Southeast University, Hong Kong Baptist University and other units jointly organized the Intelligent Medical Image Analysis and Computing Frontier Forum. A series of special lectures given by experts invited by the project:
